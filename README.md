In this project let's build a **Photo Dekho App** by applying the concepts we have learned till now. This project allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned till React Course and apply them in a concrete project.

You will demonstrate your skills by creating an app that will fetch data from an internal server using a class component, displaying that data, using **component lifecycle methods**, **routing** concepts, **authentication**, and **authorization**, and adding responsiveness to the website.

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. You will also be given feedback by code reviewers after your project submission.

### Project Submission Instructions

- For Mini Projects, you can submit the test cases at own your pace. But we suggest you to submit the code to know the percentage of completion through test cases and that score will be considered for your interviews

- For Mini Projects, you can publish/deploy the code using `ccbp publish RJSCPIHAM7 domain_name.ccbp.tech`. So that our team will be able to see that code and deployed URL (Ex: something.ccbp.tech) and will share feedback to you if required.

> ### _Things to Keep in Mind_
>
> - All components you implement should go in the `src/components` directory.
> - **Do not remove the pre-filled code**
> - Want to quickly review some of the concepts you’ve been learning? Take a look at the Cheat Sheets.
